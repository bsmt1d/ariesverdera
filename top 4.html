<p>Globally renowned for his speech ‘I Have a Dream’ in Washington, MLK is one of the most celebrated souls across the globe and is named among the great leaders of the world. Just like Gandhi, he also continued his struggles through the Civil Rights Movement for the Afro-Americans. He was a firm believer in Christianity, hence, thoroughly followed non-violence. </p>
