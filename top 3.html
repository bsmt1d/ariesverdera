<p>Regarded as the saviour of democracy, Winston Churchill was the great mind behind the victory of Britain over the Nazis. Born in an aristocratic family, he served the national army of Britain and then, later on, became the Prime Minister in 1940. Amongst his many honours, some are being elected as a PM again in 1951, Nobel Prize in Literature, etc. </p>
