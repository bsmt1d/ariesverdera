<p>Born in an ordinary Indian family in Gujrat, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was a rebellious leader of a multitude of protests that aimed to liberate India. Moments like Civil Disobedience, Dandi March, and Quit India were his brainchild and cite his glory. Later on, he was awarded the title of ‘Father of the Nation’. </p>
